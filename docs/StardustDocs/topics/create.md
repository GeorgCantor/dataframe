Different ways to create dataframes from the data that already loaded into memory,
are described in this section. You usually either [create `Column`s from iterables](createColumn.md), and then
[convert them into `DataFrame`](createDataFrame.md), or create small dataframes for tests using `vararg` variants
of the [corresponding functions](createDataFrame.md) directly from values.

Creating dataframes from files and URLs is described [in the next section](read.md)
