[//]: # (title: Update/convert values)

Both [`update`](update.md) and [`convert`](convert.md) can be used to change some values in some columns of `DataFrame`.

Difference between these operations:
* `convert` allows to change the type of the column, while `update` doesn't
* `update` allows to filter cells to be updated, while `convert` doesn't
